# PhoneNumber-Validator

This was a project that I built to get my certification on freeCodeCamp.

It's not built following a step by step guild, just a set of guildlines you had to follow.

I spend a little extra time on the UI than necessary so I'm going to post it on here and on pages.

The UI is good it's just smaller than it should be, however I'm not looking to spend anymore time on it. So onto the next project!
